## Project Description 
The primary goal of this project was to comprehend the significance of a compiler. As a computer science student, it's important to understand how to use a compiler and what goes on inside the tool we're using. It gives us the ability to create and deploy our own domain-specific language. The compiler's architecture allows for the use of formal methods that are seldom used in other programming languages. Compiler review is a good way to learn about compilers.
Compiler analysis is a great way to get acquainted with systematic methods. As a result, studying compiler will teach us a lot. That was also the aim of our project; we learned how to use a subset of a broad language, as well as its specifications and CFG. We also learned how to build a lexical analyzer and develop a parser using lexical specifications.

## Sample Language Used 
MINIJAVA is the programming language that we used to build our parser. Minijava is a condensed and updated version of the Java programming language. It is a teaching-oriented programming language based on the Java language from Sun Microsystems. The core of the MiniJava environment is a simplified version of the standard Java release, created to alleviate the fear that beginners experience when confronted with it.


The language that we have used to design our parser is MINIJAVA. Basically the minijava language is a subset of java which is more simplified and modified. It is a teaching-oriented programming language predicated on Sun Microsystems' Java language. The MiniJava environment's core is a condensed version of the standard Java release, designed to alleviate the fear that beginners feel when confronted with a framework as complex as the Java environment.A MiniJava programs purpose is determined by its meaning as a Java program. Every MiniJava program is a fully functional Java program that follows Java semantics. It supports classes and limited inheritance, simple data types and a few structured control constructors. The MiniJava software is a single file that does not have a package declaration (and therefore does not correspond to the default package) or imports. It is made up of one or more Java classes. The classes are simple and easy there are no interface classes, subclasses, or nested classes in it.
